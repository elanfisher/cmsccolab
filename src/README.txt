App Description - One or two line description.
    This is a website dedicated to researchers at UMD to share lab material. It was inspired by a deep sadness when I
    discovered that many lab materials get over-purchased or wasted by some groups while others don't get anything. 
    On this site, someone can add, reserve, and view materials to be able to be rented by a community of researchers. 
    To make users happy and keep researchers from fighting too much, there is a page where a researcher can get a random cat fact.


API links - Links to API(s) you are using.
    The API used is mewfacts (https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts), which returns a number of cat facts when queried. 
    Currently, this site only queries one of them.


YouTube Demo Video - Link to a YouTube video that provides a demo of your application. This video is very important. We will not grade a project unless a video is provided.
